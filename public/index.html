            content="Stakepool - A no loss, price prediction experiment, that makes possible to earn greater baking rewards with your Tezos stash. \n
  Stakepool lets you predict the Tezos price range for the duration of the staking cycle period and if by the end of the staking period (2 cycles), Tezos price falls in the range predicted by you, all the baking rewards accrued in the contract are distributed among the users who predicted the right price range. That means helping you earn greater rewards than you usually get. Even if you predict wrong, you only lose the staking rewards and don't need to even pay any fees to utilize the platform since we only charge a platform usage fee if you win any rewards."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
